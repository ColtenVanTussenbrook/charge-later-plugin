# charge-later-plugin

This simple WordPress plugin allows a user to display a credit card form on their website, but it doesn't actually charge the customer, it only stores the credit card info using Stripe's API. Then, the user can choose to charge the customer later on. No credit card numbers are stored in the database, only a customer ID that is used to make the charge. 

This was originally built for a hair salon so the owner could charge clients that don't show up or cancel within 24 hours of their appointments, but it could be extended for other uses.
